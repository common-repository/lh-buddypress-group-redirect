Redirect group members where they are members of only one group

== Description ==

This plugin redirects users who are only a meber of one buddypress group to the actual group page rather thab the listing of theiur groups when the user vists the buddypress User Groups page.

I wrote this plugin because on a site I built users would only ever be members of one group. As such it was pointless for them to be sent to the Buddypress user groups page, from where they would have to navigate to the the page they were a member of anyway.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I am a member of only one group, why arent I redirected? =

Probably because you are a admin or moderator, if you have the bp_moderate capability then this plugin will not redirect you.

= What is something does not work?  =

LH Buddypress Group Redirect, and all [https://lhero.org](LocalHero) plugins are made to WordPress standards. Therefore they should work with all well coded plugins and themes. However not all plugins and themes are well coded (and this includes many popular ones). 

If something does not work properly, firstly deactivate ALL other plugins and switch to one of the themes that come with core, e.g. twentyfirteen, twentysixteen etc.

If the problem persists please leave a post in the support forum: [https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-buddypress-group-redirect/](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/lh-buddypress-group-redirect/). I look there regularly and resolve most queries.

= What if I need a feature that is not in the plugin?  =
